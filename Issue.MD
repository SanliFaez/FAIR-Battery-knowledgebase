# Issues
Issues are not open, so temporally stored here. 

+ Create a separate screen for buttons as described in https://github.com/SanliFaez/FAIR-Battery-knowledgebase/blob/main/MoreInformation/UserCase%26prospects.MD
+ Feedback on GUI: Costs of batteries are important in the future. Is it possible to search on cost efficient batteries?
+ Feedback on GUI: Add battery properties to the keywords or ontology classes. (Energy density, capacity, costs, )
+ Feedback on GUI: Can this project answer practical questions such as: Is it possible to make a FAIR battery? How cheap can we go? Is the netwerk going to be active? How do you support the software? How do you keep the knowledge updated? Why would people share their knowledge? 
+ New user case: Enter a new data set of articles and/or another ontology.ttl to search new information on different keywords. This can be about batteries, but with the same afford about ducks, pizza's or snowboards.
+ Create a more fancy report page, sorted by chapter with links to each chapter and no full URL's.
+ Make notebooks runnable on Github (Maybe PyQt5 and owlready2 are not usable)
+ Ranking System: # times keyword is found, Date of publication..?
+ Link with open science badges when somebody contirbuted
+ Ranking system: Coupling with AS review in ranking system to sort results by relevance
+ tekstmine the searched data with the ontology. So make it possible to extract specific information from the text. For example, if one searches for electrolyte, it would be valuable if the program gives back the article together with the electrolyte type. 
+ semantic matching: If a certain combination of keywords is used in the Query, semantic matching can help to search for more relevant information. As an example, if somebody searches for "electrolye & Membrane" it is arguable that this person is interested in the interaction between both. So an article discribing such an interaction can be more relevant.
+ Organise a hackathon to solve technical issues
