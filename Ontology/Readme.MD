# Flow Battery Ontology

## Ontology
When people talk with each other, they use words. These words are related to each other and together they form a message. The order in which they are spoken creates context and give a specific meaning to each other. Even in the same context words can have different meanings. To conceptualize this process, people created the concept of ontology. "Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts and their properties and attributes in a domain" [1]. Since human languages are full of ambiguities, such a formal description becomes relevant for computers to understand them.

For example in the case of written text an ontology is useful to extract relevant information out of it. Therefore, several disciplines developed standard ontologies to communicate about their study objects, in the form of classification schemes, flow diagrams and other formal structures. These ontological systems are used to exchange and evolve knowledge between experts. This can foster common understanding in a certain domain and enable (re-)use of knowledge, standardize assumptions and much more.

In this project an ontology on redox flow batteries is created together with "BIG-MAP/BattINFO" <EnterLink>. To learn more about this ontology see https://github.com/SanliFaez/FAIR-Battery-knowledgebase/tree/main/Ontology. With this ontology a search machine is created to search a database of articles related to redox flow batteries.

## Flow battery ontology
The ontology of Batt Info, contains more then flow batteries. To seperate flowbatteries from other batteries, we created a seperate ontology file, to use in our interface. This is the *FAIR-Battery-ontology.owl* file, which can be found in this folder. The ontological classes in this local ontolgy are spread out over different files in the BATT Info ontology classes. Therefore FAIR-Battery-ontology.owl is used in this project.
