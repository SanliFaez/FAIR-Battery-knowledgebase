## Ontology
This section is based on the ontology development document of protege [1].
+ What is ontology
  + Elucidation
  + When people talk with eachother, they use words to communicate a certain message. These words carry the message and are related to eachother. The order in which they are spoken give a specific meaning to these words and creates a context. In different contextes, words can have a different meaning. Even in the same context words can have different meanings.
  + To concpetualize this process, people created the concept of ontology. "Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts and their properties and attributes in a domain" [1]. 
  +  For computers it is hard human language. Nevertheless, computers playing a huge part in human communication. 
  + **Ontology**, several disciplines developed standard methodologies to communicate about their study objects, in the form of classification schemes, flow diagrams and other formal structures. These so called ontological systems are used to exchange and evolve knowledge between experts. This can foster common understanding in a certain domain and enable (re-)use of knowledge, standardize assumptions and much more.

In order to work with ontologies will use the following definitions.
+ 
1. Ontology
Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts and their properties and attributes in a domain
of discourse.
+ What is flowbattery
+ Flowbattery ontology
+ Protege incl screen shots
+ Link to Battinfo and where to find 'official' ontology
+ link to wikipedia
+ Give example of ontolgy
+ Why are ontologies relevant?
+ Generate ontology automatically? https://www.openaire.eu/opscidia-ontology-generator 
+ Onto trans?

## Data Base
+ What is in the database?
    + The database contains 5000 articles related to flow batteries. The data contains, DOI, Titles, abstracts if available. 
+ Why Zotero?
    + Zotero is an open source program, 
+ What is the ideal methadata? (DOI, abstract,text,...)
+ The database is freely available on this githubpage(enter link).
+ 
## Collect Data/Search with ontology
+ Explain pyton script data collection
+ Python environment
## Search Data egine
+ Explain pytho script search egine
+ Python environment
+ Explain PyQt5 and how to add new things
+ 
## Add new data
+ How to add new data: Push data CSV, enter new data and pull request. 
## Future visions of project
+ Show ideas of the search egine as concept
+ Explain that full list of ideas is given as 'issues'
  + Create a fansy report page, sorted by chapter. 
  + Make notebooks runable on Github
  + Ranking System: # times keyword is found, Date of publication..?
  + Link with open science badges?
  + Coupling with AS review in ranking sytstem
  + semantic matching
  + seperate screens (SEE PyQt interface desgin)
  + Organise a hackaton
  + what is the ideal methadata?
## User case
+ Who should use it
  
+ Why use it?
  + To search for specific Flowbatt articles based on keywords
  + Import other data sets/ontologies if you like!
+ How to use it?
+ + Use ontology buttons/keywords
  + Type directly in program
  + Don't forget screen shots
